## <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>
I am a full stack developer looking for a full time role in the industry.

Having recently graduated from Makers Academy, a 16 week full-time software development bootcamp, I am now looking to show the skills I have developed before and during the course. 

Prior to Makers, I was a client servicing consultant at Aviva. Having spent a lot of my role liaising and assisting developers, I thought to myself - hey, why not learn the skills to become one?

Here are some of the projects I've created on my journey to becoming a software developer:

### Cooking 
Recreating meals that I've had at restaurants is a huge hobby of mine. From making the Wagamama Katsu Curry, to replicating the irreplaceable Big Mac.  
The possibilities are endless!

### Piano
So I was playing a wonderful game called Final Fantasy X, and on comes a nice tune called 'To Zanarkand' played on the piano. Inspired by it, I went and bought myself a piano with the sole purpose of playing that song.  
With sheer determintation, and a significant amount of YouTube videos, I was able to do it!  
Next on the list to learn: Nuvole Bianche, by Ludovico Einaudi.

## <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>
I am a full stack developer looking for a full time role in the industry.

Having recently graduated from Makers Academy, a 16 week full-time software development bootcamp, I am now looking to show the skills I have developed before and during the course. 

Prior to Makers, I was a client servicing consultant at Aviva. Having spent a lot of my role liaising and assisting developers, I thought to myself - why not learn the skills to become one?
